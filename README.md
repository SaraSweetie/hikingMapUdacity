# Overview
This is the final project for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. [Neighborhood Map Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view)

Using React I created a single-page application featuring a map of Pennsylvania. I added additional functionality to this application including: map markers to identify national parks, a slideout list view to support simple browsing of all locations, and a search function to easily discover these locations.

## Dependencies
- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
